 <summary><h2>‚õ∞Ô∏è My Coding Journey</h2></summary>
I began my coding journey in college, as a multimedia student. I was pretty excited, even before starting. However, things took a turn for the worst, and shortly after starting learning, I discovered that coding wasn't for me... at the time.
<br><br>
So I moved on to other realms of multimedia and ended up as a Graphic Designer. After some time, I've noticed that it wasn't for me either as I wanted more. So I needed a career change and coding started to appear on the back of my mind.
<br><br>
You see, I've never truly forgotten it after college, and it somehow became this monster that was too strong for me to defeat. But maybe not this time. Maybe I was ready enough to try again. And so I did. And so I failed. A few months passed. I tried again on my own. And I failed again. But wasn‚Äôt ready to give up just yet. I always had this idea that programmers owned the world and the array of things they could do blew my mind. And I wanted that. Since I couldn't do it alone, I took a friend's suggestion and did a coding boot camp.
<br><br>
It was hard, incredibly fast-paced but fun as hell. They say "third time's a charm" and... this time was. I finally felt I was on to something, and even though this journey was, is, and will continue to be hard, I don't see myself doing anything else.
<br><br>
So welcome to my GitHub profile and my journey into a Full-Stack Developer!!!

 <summary><h2>‚õ∞Ô∏è My Coding Journey</h2></summary>
I began my coding journey in college, as a multimedia student. It was mainly frontend and some ideas of backend, nothing too deep. I was pretty excited, even before starting. However, things took a turn for the worst, and shortly after starting learning, I discovered that coding wasn't for me... at the time.<br><br> So I moved on to other realms of multimedia and ended up as a Graphic Designer. It fulfilled me for a while but after some time, I've noticed that it wasn't for me either. I love being creative and I don't think I'll ever let go of that part of me... but I wanted more. As I started to realize that I needed a career change, coding started to appear on the back of my mind.<br><br> You see, I've never truly forgotten it after college, and it somehow became this monster that was too strong for me to defeat. But maybe not this time. Maybe I was ready enough to try again. And so I did. And so I failed. A few months passed. I tried again on my own. And I failed again. This made me think that maybe I should stick to Graphic Design and what I needed was just to fall back in love with it. And that's what I did, but the love didn't last long. At this point, I was really tired, like you must be from reading this. I promise the end is near.<br><br> I've decided I needed a proper change, this time for real, not like the times before where it was just me in front of my computer. In reality, coding was still on my mind. I always had this idea that programmers owned the world and the array of things they could do blew my mind. And I wanted that. Since I couldn't do it alone, I took a friend's suggestion and did a coding boot camp.<br><br> It was hard, incredibly fast-paced but fun as hell. They say "third time's a charm" and... this time was. I finally felt I was on to something, and even though this journey was, is, and will continue to be hard, I don't see myself doing anything else.<br><br> So welcome to my GitHub profile and my journey into a Full-Stack Developer!!!
